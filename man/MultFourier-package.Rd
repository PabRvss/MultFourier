\title{MultFourier: Efficient Computation of Multinomial Test p-values}
\description{
Computes both approximated and exact p-values for multinomial goodness-of-fit tests based on multiple test statistics, including the logP test, Pearson's chi-square, and the log-likelihood ratio statistic. The exact p-value is computed using an exhaustive algorithm recommended for small datasets, while an approximation is provided using a Fourier series algorithm for larger datasets.
}
\details{
The \code{MultFourier} package provides efficient methods for computing p-values
in multinomial tests, including both exact and approximate approaches. The exact
p-value is computed using an exhaustive algorithm, which is recommended for small
datasets. For larger datasets, an approximation is provided using a Fourier series
algorithm, which is computationally efficient and provides control over precision
through parameters such as \code{max_terms}, \code{rel_eps}, and \code{undersampling}.

The package includes the following methods:
\itemize{
  \item \code{pval_exhaustive}: Computes the exact p-value by enumerating all possible
    outcomes. Suitable for small datasets.
  \item \code{pval_fourier}: Approximates the p-value using a Fourier series
    expansion. Efficient for large datasets.
  \item \code{pval_flexible}: Automatically selects between the exhaustive and Fourier
    series methods based on the dataset size.
}

Key features:
\itemize{
  \item Control over precision through parameters such as \code{max_terms},
    \code{rel_eps}, and \code{undersampling}.
  \item Support for multiple test statistics, including logP, Pearson's chi-square,
    and log-likelihood ratio.
  \item Verbose output for debugging and analysis.
