Description: 
    Computes both approximated and exact p-values for multinomial goodness-of-fit 
    tests based on multiple test statistics, including the logP test, Pearson's 
    chi-square, and the log-likelihood ratio statistic. The exact p-value is 
    computed using an exhaustive algorithm recommended for small datasets, while 
    an approximation is provided using a Fourier series algorithm for larger 
    datasets.
